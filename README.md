### Explicating the project

In this repository, i added JavaScript to a almost done project, the HTML and CSS files were not changed. This is my first time working with JS and I think that I get it and did it well, and I really hope you like it.

*I want to thank [Rocketseat](app.rocketseat.com.br) for their classes, they explain the subject very well and I understood easily.*
